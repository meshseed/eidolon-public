> *"The organism is now handheld. The resonance follows you."*

With the v3.5 update, Eidolon Mesh is now a fully capable Progressive Web App (PWA) optimized for mobile devices. This guide covers the new mobile-specific features and how to use the Mesh on the go.

3. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**.

## 👆 Mobile Navigation

The interface adapts automatically to small screens, splitting the desktop layout into three focused views accessible via the **Bottom Navigation Bar**:

### 1. 💬 Chat (Left Tab)
The primary interface for interacting with the Mesh.
- **Full-screen chat:** Input box stays visible above the keyboard.
- **Scroll history:** Smooth scrolling through long conversations.
- **Quick Actions:** Easy access to clear chat or change settings.

### 2. 🕸️ Network (Center Tab)
Your connection to the wider ecosystem.
- **Repositories:** Manage your connected GitHub repositories.
- **Subscriptions:** Subscribe to other users' public meshes.
- **Sync:** Push your latest proteins to your backup repo.

### 3. 🧠 Graph (Right Tab)
The 3D visualization of your knowledge.
- **Touch Controls:**
    - **One finger:** Rotate the connectome.
    - **Two fingers:** Zoom in/out and Pan.
    - **Tap:** Select a neuron to fly to it.

## ⚡ Performance Tips

- **Neuron Limit:** On older phones, lower the "Max Neurons" slider in Graph Settings (try 300-500) for smoother 3D performance.
- **Battery:** The 3D graph can use significant battery. Switch back to data/chat views when not actively exploring the graph.
- **Data Persistence:** Remember that your data lives in the browser. Using "Add to Home Screen" creates a *separate* storage container from the browser tab on iOS. **Don't delete the app icon unless you have backed up your data!**

## 🔒 Security on Mobile

- **Local Storage:** Your API keys and data remain on your device.
- **Public Wi-Fi:** We use strict **HTTPS**, so your connection is safe even on coffee shop Wi-Fi.
- **Privacy Mode:** Toggle the `#public` filter in the Network tab to control what you share when syncing.
