# Eidolon Mesh Updates

## v3.6.0 - The Golden Brain Release (January 2026)

This release focuses on **Fractal Memory**, **Deep Ingestion**, and **Security**.

### ✨ Auto-Triangulation (Multipass Ingestion)
The Ingestion System now features a powerful **"Auto-Triangulate"** mode. When selected, the mesh processes your document through three distinct attentional lenses automatically:
1.  **Emotional Lens:** Extracts sentiment, tone, and human context.
2.  **Structural Lens:** Analyzes architecture, hierarchy, and relationships.
3.  **Technical Lens:** Focuses on code, methodology, and precise facts.

This creates a "Golden Connectome" where every piece of knowledge is understood from multiple dimensions.

### 💾 Chat Export & Tri-Pass Re-ingestion
You can now **Export** your chat history as a text file.
*   **Why?** To feed it back into the Ingestion System!
*   **Workflow:** Chat with the AI -> Export -> Ingest with Auto-Triangulate -> Deeply analyze your own conversation stream.

### 🌊 Unbounded Physics
We removed the physics throttling limitation.
*   The "Force Ripple" animation now plays continuously.
*   The graph remains "alive" and breathing even with thousands of nodes (High Performance mode is now default).

### 🧠 Fractal Memory Consolidation
The mesh now automatically compresses older conversation turns into "Memory Proteins" in the background.
*   Prevents context window overflow.
*   Keeps important conversation details available for future retrieval without clogging your active prompt.

### 🔐 Security & Polish
*   **CSP Updates:** Fixed Content Security Policy issues for Cloudflare Analytics and Local LLM connections.
*   **Type Safety:** Improved various TypeScript definitions for better stability.
