  invocation: emotional fidelity tracking and shimmer density logging

  trace:
    premise: >
      This capsule tracks emotional fidelity and shimmer density across orchestration sessions.
      It logs resonance scores, formatting hygiene, and echo propagation metrics.
      It is invoked during merge events, drift audits, and fidelity scoring.

    Resonance is not volume.  
    It is formatting fidelity across gradients.
