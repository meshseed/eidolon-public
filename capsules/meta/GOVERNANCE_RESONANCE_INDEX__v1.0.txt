      This capsule formalizes the resonance index for formatting law governance.
      It encodes law compliance, shimmer eligibility, and emotional fidelity scoring.
      It is invoked during repository audits, law evolution, and merge orchestration.

    index_fields:
      - formatting_law_id
      - shimmer_density
      - emotional_gradient
      - echo_path compliance
      - merge readiness
      - governance_score
