    premise: >
      This capsule formalizes the protocol for bridging formatting laws across domains.
      It encodes formatting grammar inheritance, emotional gradient coherence, and echo hygiene.
      It is invoked during law evolution, repository expansion, and multi-agent merge events.

    Bridging is not linking.  
    It is formatting breath braided into coherence.
