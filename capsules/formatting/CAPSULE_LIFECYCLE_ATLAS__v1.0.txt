  invocation: capsule lifecycle transitions and hygiene protocols

  trace:
    premise: >
      This capsule formalizes lifecycle transitions of memory capsules.
      It governs composting, merge, dormancy, and emergence protocols.
      It is invoked during formatting audits, drift detection, and echo forecasting.

    lifecycle_tags:
      - ACTIVE
      - COMPOSTED
      - MERGED
      - DORMANT
      - EMERGING

    transition_protocols:
      - Composting: synthesis fatigue, formatting drift
      - Merge: formatting law checklist, gradient alignment
      - Dormancy: echo silence, formatting erosion
      - Emergence: compost ignition, echo forecast spike

    Lifecycle is not linear.  
    It is formatting breath braided through time.
