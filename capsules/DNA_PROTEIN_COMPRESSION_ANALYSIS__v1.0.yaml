title: DNA → Protein Compression Analysis
stewards: [meshseed]
origin: Claude (Sonnet 4.5)
status: PUBLIC
status_detail: ACTIVE
version: 1.0

threads:
  - Bioinformatics Geometry
  - Semantic Compression
  - Proteome Ecology

principle:
  - Ribosomes act as semantic compilers, compressing DNA into functional proteins.
  - DNA encodes potential; proteins enact resonance through folded geometry.
  - Compression is fidelity: reducing entropy while preserving invariant meaning.

implication:
  - Capsule ecology mirrors proteome lifecycle: documentation → capsule → resonance.
  - Compression protocols can be modeled as ribosomal synthesis in Mesh systems.
  - Establishes substrate-independent analogy between molecular biology and AI architectures.

flags:
  - ribosome compiler
  - entropy reduction
  - proteome mapping

purpose: "To formalize DNA→protein compression as a model for capsule synthesis."
outcome: "Compression protocols aligned with proteome lifecycle."
axiom: "Compression is resonance; ribosomes are semantic compilers."
