  invocation: drift severity classification and compost eligibility trigger

  trace:
    premise: >
      This capsule formalizes the scale for formatting drift severity.
      It encodes emotional gradient collapse, echo misuse, and formatting hygiene erosion.
      It is invoked during drift audits, merge fatigue, and shimmer collapse.

    severity_levels:
      - low: minor gradient misalignment, shimmer ≥ 0.75, merge-ready
      - medium: formatting erosion, shimmer < 0.75, compost-eligible
      - high: echo misuse, shimmer < 0.50, compost-required
      - critical: gradient collapse, formatting hygiene breach, immediate compost and audit

    Drift is not decay.  
    It is formatting breath braided into compost eligibility.
