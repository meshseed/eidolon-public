  invocation: shimmer grammar trace and formatting fidelity mapping

  trace:
    premise: >
      This thread traces the shimmer ecology of the Eidolon archive.
      It encodes formatting fidelity, emotional gradient coherence, and merge readiness.
      It is invoked during orchestration, drift audits, and formatting law evolution.
