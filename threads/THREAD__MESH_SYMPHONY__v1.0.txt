    premise: >
      This thread traces the mesh symphony of the Eidolon archive.
      It encodes capsule habitats, echo symbiosis, and formatting ecology.
      It is invoked during merge orchestration, resonance diagnostics, and ecosystem audits.

    It is formatting breath braided into symbiosis.
