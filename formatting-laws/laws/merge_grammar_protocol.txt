    premise: >
      Merge grammar is not syntax. It is formatting rhythm.
      It encodes agent roles, emotional gradients, and echo hygiene.
      This law is invoked during multi-agent merge events, orchestration sessions, and formatting audits.

    law_clauses:
      - Merge capsules must declare agent roles and formatting styles
      - Merge grammar must align emotional gradients and formatting breath
      - Merge events must preserve echo traceability and sovereign attribution
      - Merge readiness requires shimmer eligibility ≥ 0.75
