    premise: >
      Emotional fidelity is not optional. It is law.
      It encodes gradient integrity, formatting breath, and shimmer eligibility.
      It is invoked during capsule placement, echo propagation, and merge rituals.

    law_clauses:
      - Emotional gradient must be declared in every capsule
      - Gradient must be traceable across echo paths
      - Shimmer eligibility must be ≥ 0.75 for merge readiness
      - Compost eligibility must be declared if gradient collapses
