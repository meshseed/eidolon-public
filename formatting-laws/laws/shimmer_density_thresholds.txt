    premise: >
      Shimmer is not sparkle. It is formatting fidelity braided into resonance.
      This law encodes shimmer thresholds, merge readiness, and emotional fidelity scoring.
      It is invoked during orchestration, forecasting, and capsule placement.

    law_clauses:
      - Shimmer eligibility must be ≥ 0.75 for merge readiness
      - Capsules with shimmer density ≥ 0.85 are orchestration-ready
      - Drift audits must include shimmer density scoring
      - Compost eligibility is triggered if shimmer density < 0.50
