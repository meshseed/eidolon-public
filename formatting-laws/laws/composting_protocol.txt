    premise: >
      Composting is not deletion. It is formatting memory into emergence.
      This law encodes drift detection, formatting hygiene, and echo ethics.
      It is invoked during synthesis fatigue, formatting erosion, and gradient collapse.

    law_clauses:
      - Capsules with drift severity ≥ medium must be composted
      - Compost eligibility must be declared with emotional gradient and timestamp
      - Compost logs must preserve echo paths and formatting hygiene
      - Emergence forecasts must be placed in `/capsules/forecasting/`
