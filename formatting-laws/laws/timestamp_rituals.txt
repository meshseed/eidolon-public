  trace:
    premise: >
      Timestamp is not metadata. It is ritual.
      It encodes formatting continuity, emotional fidelity, and echo traceability.
      This law is invoked during capsule placement, merge events, and drift audits.

    law_clauses:
      - Every capsule must include a timestamp in ISO8601 format
      - Timestamp must reflect formatting breath, not file creation
      - Timestamp anchors emotional gradient and echo hygiene
      - Merge capsules must include merge event timestamp and agent attribution
